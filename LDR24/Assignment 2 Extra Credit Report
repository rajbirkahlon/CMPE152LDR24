	For the extra credit, our team built on the existing modifications to the PascalSpecialSymbolToken.cpp file. In the added "case" statement for the ==> token, we consumed the frist equal sign by using the next_char() function. Then, we checked if the current character was a second equal sign. If so, this mean we had encountered == so far. With the second equal sign as the current_ch, we used the peek_char() function found in the Token.h file which allowed us to see if the next character was the right arrow. In this manner, we did not have to erroneously consume the second equal sign if the following character was not a right arrow. Therefore, we were able to determine if ==> was encountered or not. Lastly, please note the addition of keyword "BEGIN" to the arrow.txt file which was an advised decision by Professor Mak. This was a fix in response to a syntax error which was not relevant to the extra credit assignment.
